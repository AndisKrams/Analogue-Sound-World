# Analogue Sound World

## Project goals

The project's goal is to create a website for a musical equipment store, specialising in an analogue synthesisers. Website should give visitors an insight of available instrument choices, including portable low cost options to try generation of analogue sounds.

## Site owners goals

* To show prospective customers the range of products available in the shop.
* Clearly show location and opening times.
* To help interessents get in touch via contact form.

## User stories

* As a site visitor I need easy navigation and a user-friendly design, with a responsive layout for my device, so I can find information easily.
* As a musician I need to know what equipment is available in the shop.
* As a Prospective Customer, I need to find essential information such as location, contact details, and opening hours, so I can easily plan my visit or get in touch with the shop.
* As a vintage instrument owner, I need to get in touch with the shop about reselling my gear.
* As an amateur musician, I need to know about low cost options to try analogue synthesisers.

## Design choices

* The website has a Bootstrap grid layout to provide resposivenes for different screen sizes.
* Products list consists of cards with representative images for visual engagement.
* As the site isn't text-heavy I have  chosen dark mode.
* As the content sections are short they are placed vertically on the main page with the links to each section in navbar. Only the vintage instruments section with enquiries form has a separate page.

## Site features

* Navigation fixed on the top of the screen with a toggle button for smaller screen sizes.
* List of available equipment range, including more affordable products.
* Information about reselling vintage instruments with contact form for enquiries.
* Contact details section with opening times.

## Technologies used

* Bootstrap
* Squoosh to resize and compress images for web use.
* To generate a colour palette from the uploaded image I used  <http://colormind.io> . As some results lacked acceptable contrast I used <https://mycolor.space/> generator to expand the colour palette.
* For checking contrast I used <https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/> .
